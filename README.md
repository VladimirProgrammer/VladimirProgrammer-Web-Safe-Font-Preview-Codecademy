# Web-Safe-Font-Preview-Codecademy
This is the project of Codecademy "Learn jQuery" course. It was really interesting to do it that i'have decided to upload this project to my github pages. This is actually a simple app to preview different web safe fonts, sizes, and weights. In general the keyup and change event handlers of jQuery are used to make this app (project) run.
